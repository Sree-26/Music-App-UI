## 🧠 Future AI/ML Roadmap (Research Goals)
As an AIML student, I plan to evolve this UI into a research-based project by integrating:
1.  **Context-Aware Recommendations:** Implementing a Transformer-based model to suggest music based on user listening history and time of day.
2.  **Audio Sentiment Analysis:** Visualizing the "mood" of a song using CNNs for waveform analysis.
3.  **Voice-Activated Controls:** Integrating a lightweight NLP model for hands-free navigation within the app.
